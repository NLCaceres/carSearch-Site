      "body": "<p>Subcompact cars come with certain advantages. They're small (some are three feet shorter and a foot more narrow than a large SUV), obviously, which makes them accommodating companions on congested city streets. Many are also supremely fuel efficient, and this will save you money at the pump.</p>\n\n<p>If you're shopping for a subcompact, a used car offers the best value. The fact that cars depreciate by as much 28 percent after just a year of ownership puts used car shoppers in a position to realize huge savings.</p>\n\n<p>Though used car prices in general have been rising, the prices of used small cars have seen notable declines. In the subcompact segment, prices have dipped by an average of 6.3 percent year over year. This is clearly a function of the current preference for trucks and SUVs. America's ongoing romance with larger vehicles has also brought a broad array of used small cars to the market as many owners of subcompacts have been trading up into models that have more generous dimensions.</p>\n\n<p>This means it's a great time to shop for used subcompacts, and the list below highlights 10 of the best picks on the market. All of the selections on our list have seen price declines over the past year and provide you with the chance to realize substantial savings.</p>\n\n<p>It's essential for your car to be in sync with your budget, but we considered more than just pricing. We also looked at overall quality and performance when making our selections, so our choices will likely meet your needs in more ways than one.</p>\n\n<p>The range of models we've chosen is diverse. You'll find the sporty Ford Fiesta, the fuel-sipping Toyota Prius C and the versatile Honda Fit.</p>\n\n<p>We list our selections alphabetically by make and model. For each pick, our link highlights the most recent choice among the model years we've recommended.</p>\n\n<p>1. <a href=\"/chevrolet/sonic/2015/\">2012-2015 Chevrolet Sonic</a> </p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"//services.edmunds-media.com/image-service/media-ed/ximm/?quality=75&image=/chevrolet/sonic/2015/fe/2015_chevrolet_sonic_actr34_fe_1026161_717.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" alt=\"10 Used Subcompact Car Bargains\"></p>\n\n<p>Launched in 2012 and available as a sedan and a hatchback, the Chevrolet Sonic blends lively handling with strong fuel efficiency. A rearview camera, lane departure warning and forward collision warning became available in model year 2014, so choose a 2014 or newer model if these features are important to you. </p>\n\n<p>The selling price of a used 2014 Chevrolet Sonic at dealerships dropped 19 percent in 2016 from its 2015 price, according to Edmunds transaction data.</p>\n\n<p>2. <a href=\"/ford/fiesta/2015/\">2011-2015 Ford Fiesta</a> </p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"//services.edmunds-media.com/image-service/media-ed/ximm/?quality=75&image=/ford/fiesta/2015/fe/2015_ford_fiesta_f34_fe_1026161_717.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" alt=\"10 Used Subcompact Car Bargains\"></p>\n\n<p>Introduced in 2011 and offered in sedan and hatchback configurations, the Fiesta brings sharp handling and a relatively high-end interior to the subcompact segment.

      "body": "<p>If you're shopping for a family sedan, safety is undoubtedly high on your list of must-have features. But it's not always easy to sort out which cars are the very safest. There are two testing organizations that do different kinds of crash tests and can issue different ratings. Further, new safety features are debuting in cars every model year, changing our traditional definitions of what makes a car safe.</p>\n\n<p>To make safe-car shopping easier, Edmunds brings you this list, which shows the 2016 sedans that have received the highest rating, <a href=\"//www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/TSP-List\">Top Safety Pick+</a>, from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and the top five-star overall rating from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's <a href=\"//www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/2011-Newer+Vehicles/Search-Results?searchtype=model&make=TOYOTA&model=RAV4&year=2016\">5-Star Safety Ratings testing</a>. <a href=\"//www.safercar.gov/Vehicle+Shoppers/5-Star+Safety+Ratings/my2016-5-star-tests\">NHTSA does not test all cars</a>, however, so this list includes a few 2016 vehicles that have not been tested by NHTSA but that have received IIHS' Top Safety Pick+ rating.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Crash Tests Aren't the Only Measure</strong><br>\nCrash testing was once the primary standard used to judge vehicle safety. But that's changing. In addition to testing cars for how well they perform in crashes, <a href=\"//www.safercar.gov/Safety+Ratings\">NHTSA</a> and <a href=\"//www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings\">IIHS</a> now also recommend that car shoppers look for vehicles with \"active\" safety equipment: technology that is meant to help drivers avoid getting into accidents. IIHS awards its Top Safety Pick+ rating to vehicles with front crash protection systems that include automatic emergency braking. NHTSA does not currently use crash-avoidance technology in determining its star ratings, but its ratings do show shoppers which vehicles have lane departure warning systems, forward collision warning systems or rearview cameras. </p>\n\n<p>Of course, all the sedans on this list have the safety equipment that is required by federal law: front airbags for the driver and front passenger, tire pressure monitoring systems and electronic stability control, which incorporates antilock brakes and traction control. </p>\n\n<p>We've listed some of the key safety features in each car as well as safety-related extras that might interest you. And when Edmunds has tested a car, we show the results of our own brake tests. The cars are listed alphabetically within three size groups: compact and subcompact sedans, midsize sedans and full-size sedans. </p>\n\n<p>Look for our list of 2017 safest sedans soon.

      "body": "<p>What is a cool car? For some, it could be a classic muscle  car; for others, a brand-new Ferrari. It could be a heavy-duty pickup <a href=\"//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_coal\" target=\"_blank\">rolling coal</a> or a Prius  sipping gas to save the planet. In other words, this is a 100 percent  subjective list of cars.</p>\n\n<p>To determine our list of cool used cars for $22,000, we  started with the average retail price of a used vehicle: just under $19,000, according  to Edmunds research. Then we defined the set as vehicles that eschew many  aspects of practicality &mdash; and therefore mass-market popularity &mdash; for performance, style and, simply, being cool. It's no coincidence  that virtually all our choices have two doors and impeccable fun-to-drive  credentials. We also tried to make selections that are of a reasonable age (no  classic cars) and won't bankrupt you with endless pricey repairs (i.e., no <a href=\"/mercedes-benz/cl-class/2005/long-term-road-test/introduction.html\">big-depreciation  ultra-luxury cars</a>). </p>\n\n<p>After hours of online searching for such cars at $19K, we determined  that the price wasn't yielding enough candidates, so we raised the ceiling to  $22,000 and found the sweet spot. Basically, these are cool used cars within  reason. </p>\n\n<p>Edmunds has lots of tools to help in your cool-used quest,  including <a href=\"/used-cars/for-sale/\">used-car inventory</a> search, <a href=\"/appraisal/\">used-car  appraisal</a> (so you'll know what that car should be selling for) and tips on  how to be a <a href=\"/car-buying/how-to-use-edmunds-com-to-buy-a-used-car.html\">smart  used-car shopper</a>. Let's see what cars suit you.</p>\n  \n<p><strong>1. Ford Mustang </strong></p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"//services.edmunds-media.com/image-service/media-ed/ximm/?quality=75&image=/ford/mustang/2013/fe/2013_ford_mustang_f34_fe_801161_717.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" alt=\"11 Cool Used Cars Under $22K\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Suggested Years: 2011-2014</strong></p>\n\n<p>With the exception of some unfortunateness in the 1970s, the  Ford Mustang has always been cool. It's also always been relatively affordable.  The Mustang you'd get for $22,000 depends on its year, mileage, engine and body  style (coupe or convertible). We'd happily get an older V8-powered GT coupe  with fewer miles, as opposed to a newer model with the V6. The 2011-2014 model  years are key here, thanks to serious V6 and V8 engine upgrades that began in  2011. This was especially important for the V6, which went from a must-avoid  rental car engine to one that nearly made as much horsepower as the outgoing  V8. But the V8 got a big-time bump, too. In fact, the same basic engine  continues to power the current Mustang GT.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/ford/mustang/for-sale/\">Check  out a used Mustang near you</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Mini Cooper</strong></p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"//services.edmunds-media.com/image-service/media-ed/ximm/?quality=75&image=/mini/cooper/2013/fe/2013_mini_cooper_f34_fe_801161_717.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" alt=\"11 Cool Used Cars Under $22K\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Suggested Years: 2013-2015</strong></p>\n\n<p>Since its reintroduction more than a decade ago, the Mini  Cooper has possessed the unique ability to be cool to a variety of different  buyers. Men, women, young, old &mdash; it doesn't matter. It's a great  choice if you're attracted to its wildly fun \"go kart\" driving  experience or if you love its cute retro looks and nearly endless customization  possibilities. The 2013-2015 model years are best because cars in that age range  are likely to be certified pre-owned cars. That means extra warranty coverage  and Mini-certified vehicle inspection (both very important given Mini's  less-than-stellar reliability record). Note, too, that these dates cross two  different generations. The older generation Mini is arguably better looking and  sharper to drive, while the newer one is more efficient and refined. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/mini/cooper/for-sale/?invType=CPO\">Check out a  used Mini near you</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Scion FR-S and  Subaru BRZ</strong></p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"//services.edmunds-media.com/image-service/media-ed/ximm/?quality=75&image=/scion/fr-s/2016/fe/2016_scion_fr-s_f34_fe_801161_717.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" alt=\"11 Cool Used Cars Under $22K\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Suggested Years: Any (2013-current model year)</strong></p>\n\n<p>Scion and Subaru's twin coupes represent one of the easiest ways to have a lot  of fun behind the wheel for not a lot of money. Credit their small size, light  weight and power sent to the rear wheels. Then you can throw in an  easy-to-drive nature that will amuse and reward expert and novice drivers  alike. The FR-S and BRZ look pretty cool and, unlike most sporting cars, they don't  cost a fortune to fill. Given their reasonable price even when new, you should  be able to get an FR-S or BRZ with relatively low miles for $22,000.

Unlike  the twins, though, the S2000 has a thrilling, high-strung engine that  represents Honda at its absolute best. (It comes in two versions, the second  debuting for 2004.) Obviously, an S2000 is an older used car, meaning you're  more likely to deal with maintenance issues. By reputation, though, the S2000  is one of the most reliable sports cars ever built, so if you look for one with  lower mileage and minimal modifications, you could have a perfectly dependable  roadster for $22,000.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/honda/s2000/for-sale/\">Check  out a used S2000 near you</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>5.

But a  Boxster shouldn't be <em>that</em> bad if it  was well cared for by its previous owner (or owners). Besides, the Porsche  Boxster is unquestionably cool and one of the best cars to drive, period. Since  many Boxsters have been used as weekend cars, you won't have too hard a time  finding plenty in seemingly great condition and with reasonable miles for  $22,000. Note that Porsche introduced a new generation Boxster for 2005, so the  2005-'08 models will feel fresher and more capable. But the earlier cars are  certainly still desirable. </p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/porsche/boxster/for-sale/\">Check  out a used Boxster near you</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Jeep Wrangler</strong></p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"//services.edmunds-media.com/image-service/media-ed/ximm/?quality=75&image=/jeep/wrangler/2012/fe/2012_jeep_wrangler_actf34_fe_802161_717.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" alt=\"11 Cool Used Cars Under $22K\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Suggested Years: 2012 or later</strong></p>\n\n<p>If there's a poster child for shunning practicality in order  to be cool, it's got to be the Jeep Wrangler. This is an SUV with removable  doors, windshield and roof. It has an ancient suspension and steering design  that does a great job navigating rocks and trails, but is totally lousy on  pavement. It is loud, rough-riding and not especially nice inside. But, oh boy,  is it cool. All model years have that cachet, but we recommend one produced for  2012 or later when Jeep radically upgraded its engine in terms of both power  and fuel economy. Note, however, that Wranglers don't depreciate much, so there's  a decent chance a new one won't be much more expensive than a used model. This  is one case where stretching a bit beyond $22K in order to get a new car could  be a sound financial decision.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"/jeep/wrangler/for-sale/\">Check  out a used Wrangler near you</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>7.

Unlike the Jeep, though, the FJ has  sterling reliability ratings, is much better to drive on road and is generally  more refined. FJ Cruisers have held onto their value extremely well, so at our  $22,000 price point, there's a good chance you'll be dealing with an older  model or a newer one with higher mileage. Either way, its seven years of  production and its Toyota heritage should assuage most fears regarding older  used cars.</p>\n  \n<p><a href=\"/toyota/fj-cruiser/for-sale/\">Check  out a used FJ Cruiser near you</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>8.

It is also  literally the last 3 Series coupe and convertible. The two-door 3 Series is now  known as the 4 Series. These cars are brilliant to drive and easy on the eyes,  possessing a beautifully proportioned sleekness that contrasts with its boxier  predecessors. Even the convertible's trick retractable hardtop doesn't result  in the typical bulbous rear end. That hardtop may cause some repair headaches,  and indeed, any BMW is likely to be pricier to maintain than most of the cars  on this list. But if you're looking for a classically cool German car at a  modest price, a two-door 3 Series may be for you.</p>\n\n  <a href=\"/bmw/3-series/for-sale/\">Check  out a used BMW 3 Series near you</a></p>\n  \n<p><strong>9. Chevrolet Corvette</strong></p>\n\n<p><img data-dsrc=\"//services.edmunds-media.com/image-service/media-ed/ximm/?quality=75&image=/chevrolet/corvette/2004/fe/2004_chevrolet_corvette_f34_fe_802161_717.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" alt=\"11 Cool Used Cars Under $22K\"></p>\n\n<p><strong>Suggested Years: 1997-2004</strong></p>\n  \n<p>If you want a classically cool American car rather than a  German one, there's no better place to turn than to Corvette. Really, any  Corvette of any age would be cool, but since the older ones can get rather  expensive, let's go for a more recent suggestion. For $22K, you could probably  get a sixth-generation Corvette (C6, in Corvette parlance), but it would have  higher miles and perhaps less TLC than a Corvette deserves. Our advice is to  look for a low-mileage car from the fifth generation (C5) that's been  affectionately maintained. If you want C6-matching performance, you can even find  a C5 Corvette Z06 for $22,000 or thereabouts. Edmunds had a <a href=\"/chevrolet/corvette/2002/long-term-road-test/introduction.html\">long-term  Z06 test car</a> and we loved it.</p>\n  \n<p><a href=\"/chevrolet/corvette/1990/used/vin/?vin=1G1YZ23J0L5802511\">Check  out a used Corvette near you</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>10.

If you want a cool car that's  still plenty useful, this retro muscle coupe is a fantastic choice with its  adult-sized backseat and relatively enormous trunk. Available in a variety of  models, the Challenger can look cool in a stealthy sort of way (black) or in a  brash, \"look at me!\" sort of way (Plum Crazy purple). We recommend  one of the V8-powered models, but should you be more into the Challenger's look  than its performance, a V6-powered one from 2014 or later should work just fine.  The earlier V6 Challengers were underpowered and barely more efficient than the  V8. The updated V6, on the other hand, is a satisfying choice. </p>\n  \n<p><a href=\"/dodge/challenger/for-sale/\">Check  out a used Challenger near you</a></p>\n\n<p><strong>11.

However, as nice as the E-Class is, it isn't necessarily  cool. But the Jaguar XF is a different sort of luxury sedan. Not only does its  sleek styling stand out from the conservative crowd, but its distinctively  styled cabin features unique details, such as a power-retracting rotary shifter  and rotating air vents, that make each journey just a little more special. And  if you really want special, seek out an XF with the silky smooth and gloriously  quick supercharged V8 engine. A word of warning, however: Although Jaguar's  reliability is exponentially better than in the past (Edmunds' long-term XF was<a href=\"/jaguar/xf/2012/long-term-road-test/introduction.html\"> trouble-free</a>),  it's still a complicated luxury sedan. Grab the newest one you can find. </p>\n  \n<p><a href=\"/jaguar/xf/for-sale/\">Check  out a used Jaguar XF near you</a></p>"

Because these cars have standard gasoline  or diesel engines, they are more affordable than cars with costlier hybrid and  electric drivetrains, which can send purchase prices skyward and can require years  to recover the purchase price through fuel-efficiency savings &mdash; particularly  when gas prices are low.</p>\n\n<p>Some of the cars listed are specialized,  low-volume variants of more mainstream models. Some achieve their fuel efficiency  with special equipment packages not found on the volume sellers. In other  words, the fuel-sippers aren't always easy to find, but if efficiency and cost  savings are your goals, they can be well worth the hunt.</p>\n\n<p>Remember, though, that the EPA ratings are  based on laboratory tests and should be considered guidelines for what you can  expect with a moderate driving style. Real-world fuel efficiency depends on  numerous factors, including cargo loads and the weight of the driver's foot on  the accelerator.</p>\n\n<p>We've ranked the cars according to their  fuel-efficiency ratings.

The SE trim level of the 2016  Fiesta is eligible for the EcoBoost Fuel Economy package (which the EPA's  fueleconomy.gov site renders as the <a href=\"//www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=36718\" target=\"_blank\">Fiesta  SFE</a>). The Fuel Economy package uses  a turbocharged three-cylinder, 1.0-liter engine, a five-speed manual  transmission, special wheels and tires and some aerodynamic improvements to  achieve better fuel economy than the average Fiesta. City mileage comes in at  31 mpg, and the combined mileage rating is 36 mpg. The 2016 Ford Fiesta's  nimble handling and nicely trimmed cabin make it a pleasant everyday companion,  though its modest interior space is a factor to consider.

The Scion  iA is new for 2016 and is Toyota's version of the Mazda 2, which isn't being  sold in the U.S. With its 1.5-liter engine and six-speed automatic, the Scion  iA returns 33 mpg in city driving and 37 mpg combined. With the standard  six-speed manual transmission, efficiency drops a bit but remains very  respectable: 41 mpg on the highway, 31 mpg in the city and 35 mpg combined.

These three trim levels use Honda's new turbocharged  1.5-liter engine and a continuously variable transmission (<a href=\"/car-technology/cvt-enters-the-mainstream.html\">CVT</a>) to achieve their fuel efficiency numbers. Some other Civics also will  achieve 40 mpg highway or better, depending on their engine and transmission configurations.  Check our review for full details.

The first diesels on our  list, the 2016 BMW 328d sedan, its all-wheel-drive variant, the 328d xDrive and  the all-wheel-drive 328d xDrive Sports Wagon, are among the best-equipped and  most fun-to-drive cars that achieve 40 mpg or better on the highway. The rear-wheel-drive version of the 2016 328d sedan gets an estimated 32 mpg city  and 36 mpg combined, while the xDrive models return 40 mpg on the highway, 30  in the city and 34 combined. All three use 2.0-liter turbodiesel engines, mated  in the sedans to seven-speed automatic transmissions and in the wagon to an  eight-speed automatic. We find the BMW 3 Series diesels &mdash; even the  wagon &mdash; to be sporty and refined, and count them among our favorites  in the compact luxury class.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. </strong><a href=\"/ford/focus/2016/\">2016 Ford Focus</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"//services.edmunds-media.com/image-service/media-ed/ximm/?quality=85&image=/ford/focus/2016/fe/2016_ford_focus_f34_fe_212161_717.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" alt=\"Best Gas and Diesel Cars With 40 MPG on Highway\"></p>\n\n<p>42 mpg highway. There are two versions of the  2016 Ford Focus that achieve 40 mpg or better. Leading the pack is the <a href=\"//www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/Find.do?action=sbs&id=36981\" target=\"_blank\">Focus SE EcoBoost</a> with a turbocharged three-cylinder,  1.0-liter engine and six-speed manual. It also gets 30 mpg city and 35 mpg  combined. The same Focus model with a six-speed automatic sees highway mileage  drop to 40 mpg, with a 28-mpg city rating and a combined rating of 32 mpg. The  2016 Ford Focus S, SE and Titanium models with a 2.0-liter engine and six-speed  automatic deliver 40 mpg highway, 27 city and 31 combined. The Focus offers  sporty looks, well-balanced handling and an attractive interior. But be aware  that the backseat is tight and acceleration is underwhelming.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. </strong><a href=\"/mercedes-benz/e-class/2016/diesel/\">2016 Mercedes-Benz E250 Bluetec</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"//services.edmunds-media.com/image-service/media-ed/ximm/?quality=85&image=/mercedes-benz/e-class/2016/fe/2016_mercedes-benz_e-class_actf34_fe_212161_717.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" alt=\"Best Gas and Diesel Cars With 40 MPG on Highway\"></p>\n\n<p>42 mpg highway. The only other diesel on our  list is the 2016 Mercedes-Benz E250 Bluetec, a midsize sedan that keeps up,  fuel-efficiency-wise, with the smaller BMW diesels on the highway. But the  Mercedes is heavier and its city rating drops to 28 mpg, with a combined rating  of 33 mpg. Power comes from a 2.1-liter turbodiesel via a seven-speed  automatic. The Mercedes E-Class' superb ride, elegant interior and  sophisticated electronics epitomize the midsize luxury sedan.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. </strong><a href=\"/honda/fit/2016/\">2016 Honda Fit</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"//services.edmunds-media.com/image-service/media-ed/ximm/?quality=85&image=/honda/fit/2016/top10/2016_honda_fit_f34_top10_121161_717.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" alt=\"Best Gas and Diesel Cars With 40 MPG on Highway\"></p>\n\n<p>41 mpg highway.

There are several versions of  the Mazda 3 in the 40 mpg club: two body styles, sedan and hatchback; two  transmission types, manual and automatic; and two engine sizes, 2.0-liter and  2.5-liter. Overall, we find the Mazda 3 to be one of the best all-around  compact cars in the market, with sporty driving characteristics, a comfortable  ride and one of the nicest interiors in the non-luxury segment.</p>\n\n<p>The 2016 Mazda 3i models all come with a 2.0-liter  engine. The 3i sedan is the 41-mpg winner. With a six-speed automatic, the 3i  sedan also gets 30 mpg city and 34 combined, while the 3i sedan with a six-speed  manual gets 29 mpg city and 33 mpg combined. The Mazda 3i hatchback gets a 40  mpg highway rating, with the six-speed automatic version returning 30 mpg city  and 33 mpg combined and the six-speed manual rated at 29 mpg city and 33 mpg  combined. The Mazda 3s sedan with the 2.5-liter engine and six-speed automatic  is rated at 40 mpg highway, 29 mpg city and 33 mpg combined.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9. </strong><a href=\"/chevrolet/sonic/2016/review/\">2016 Chevrolet Sonic</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"//services.edmunds-media.com/image-service/media-ed/ximm/?quality=85&image=/chevrolet/sonic/2016/fe/2016_chevrolet_sonic_f34_fe_212161_717.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" alt=\"Best Gas and Diesel Cars With 40 MPG on Highway\"></p>\n\n<p>40 mpg highway. The 2016 Chevrolet Sonic,  with its 29 mpg city and 33 mpg combined ratings may be near the bottom of this  list, but its availability in both sedan and hatchback body styles and its  blend of safety features, driving dynamics, comfort and plentiful standard  equipment makes it one of our top subcompact choices overall. With their  five-speed manual transmissions, you can expect the necessary fuel efficiency  from the Sonic sedan or hatchback in LT trim with the standard 1.4-liter  turbocharged engine or from the LTS trim with the turbo 1.4-liter option.<strong></strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>10. </strong><a href=\"/mazda/6/2016/\">2016  Mazda 6</a></p>\n\n<p><img src=\"//services.edmunds-media.com/image-service/media-ed/ximm/?quality=85&image=/mazda/6/2016/top10/2016_mazda_6_f34_top10_205161_717.jpg\" width=\"690\" height=\"460\" alt=\"Best Gas and Diesel Cars With 40 MPG on Highway\"></p>\n\n<p>40 mpg highway.

      "body": "<p><strong>Quick Summary</strong><br>\nThe  all-new 2016 Scion iM is a compact hatchback in a very competitive segment. It's  comfortable and delivers plenty of features for the price, but its performance and  interior space fall below the segment best. </p>\n\n<@shoppingUnit shopUnitImg=\"/scion/im/2016/oem/2016_scion_im_4dr-hatchback_base_fq_oem_9_175.jpg\" />\n  \n<p><strong>What Is It?</strong><br>\nThe  2016 Scion iM is a compact, four-door hatchback that competes with the Ford  Focus, Kia Forte 5, Mazda 3 and VW Golf. The iM is based on the Toyota Corolla  and comes with a similar 137-horsepower, 1.8-liter, four-cylinder engine. This  is good when it comes to likely reliability, but it doesn't produce enough  power to be competitive. </p>\n\n<p>The  iM is about 2 inches shorter in height than these rivals, narrower in width by  an inch or two and splits the difference in overall length between the Focus  and Elantra GT. The Mazda 3 is the biggest in this class, measuring 5 inches  longer than the iM with about a 4-inch-longer wheelbase. The Scion has a  sportier appearance than most other hatchbacks, with sharp body creases, a raked-back  windshield and side skirts that give it an aggressive stance.</p>\n\n<p>Haggle-free  pricing starts at $19,995 for the iM with a continuously variable transmission  (CVT), or $19,255 if you choose the six-speed manual. These price points  represent a sort of sweet spot for the segment, while the features list is  actually more generous than usual among similarly priced competitors. Standard  features like 17-inch alloy wheels, a rearview camera and iPod/USB auxiliary  audio are increasingly the norm, but the iM distinguishes itself from the rest  by also adding two years of free scheduled maintenance, keyless ignition and  entry, power-folding mirrors, dual-zone automatic climate control and a 7-inch  touchscreen audio system with Internet streaming radio and apps. Navigation is  available as an option, as are various sporty exterior enhancements and  suspension alterations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How Does It Drive?</strong><br>\nThere's  a standard 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine under the hood that delivers 137 hp  and 126 pound-feet of torque. That's not a lot, even for the compact-car  segment, and the iM constantly reminds you of it. Acceleration is near the  bottom of the class, needing 10 seconds to go from zero to 60 mph. Most  competitors are at least 1 or 2 seconds quicker, and it's a difference you can feel  in the real world. Whether merging onto a highway or pulling away from a  traffic light, the engine feels weak and overmatched while emitting thrashy,  uncouth noises that make accelerating slowly a more palatable driving choice.</p>\n  \n<p>Should  you do that, the CVT will provide impeccably smooth \"acceleration.\"  Should you opt to drive with a little more gusto, the CVT actually does a  pretty good job (many do not) getting what it can from the little engine. An  even heavier foot will cause the CVT to simulate gearchanges, making it feel  more like a conventional automatic and mitigating the usual droning noises  indicative of this alternative transmission type. There's even a Sport mode  that did an impressive job of holding revs high on both the uphill and downhill  stretches of our standard evaluation route.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike  the engine, the iM's handling is a clear improvement upon the Corolla. There's  more driver engagement to be found, with a reasonably playful and agile  attitude detected both at our test track and in the real world. Yet, while it  doesn't dissuade one to drive with some enthusiasm, it doesn't encourage it  like some competitors do &mdash; especially the Mazda 3. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Is It Comfortable?</strong><br>\nThe  iM's ride quality drew praise. Our editors almost universally returned from  driving this latest Scion impressed by the comfort and composure exhibited by  its suspension. It generally feels more grown-up and sophisticated than past,  unsubstantial-feeling Scions as well as being an improvement upon the Corolla. It  really is one of the iM's stand-out attributes.</p>\n  \n<p>Front-seat  space is also quite good, with just enough driver-seat adjustment for tall  drivers. The seats themselves also drew universal praise, with more lateral  support than normal for the segment and firm cushions that prevented fatigue  after many hours behind the wheel. This is yet another area where the iM  outpaces the Corolla. </p>\n\n<p>The  same cannot be said of the backseat, which is one of the smallest in the  segment along with the Ford Focus. Headroom is acceptable, but legroom is  comparatively restrictive. We're not sure we'd call it cramped &mdash; it  actually would've been quite good not so long ago, but today's rivals are more  spacious, with the Mazda 3 providing an additional 3 inches of legroom.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How Nice Is the Interior?</strong><br>\nTo  date, Scions have been known for cabins constructed of hard, black plastic and  not an ounce of anything one could deem \"premium.\" That changes with  the new iM, which has materials that give up little (if anything) to its  competitors. Most of the surfaces you see or frequently touch are soft, while  everything else is at least of a quality appearance and texture. We especially  appreciated the padded area on the center console where the driver can rest  their leg. The standard dual-zone automatic climate controls look as if they  were removed from a far more expensive car, boasting a nice glossy feel, solid  movement and easy-to-use operation.</p>\n  \n<p>The  standard 7-inch touchscreen is a tad aftermarket in its appearance (that's  because it's made by Pioneer), but like those in other Toyota-group cars, it is  refreshingly easy to use and very quick to react to inputs. We also thought the  sound system was above average for a $20,000 car. </p>\n  \n<p>Forward  visibility is excellent, thanks to the narrow roof pillars and a steeply  slanted hood that provide an expansive view of the road. On the other hand,  rear visibility is reduced by a short hatch window and large rear roof pillars,  forcing heavy reliance on the standard rearview camera.</p>\n\n<p>Cargo  space is also far from ideal. The trunk is usefully wide, but it's not that  deep and there's very little space above the rigid cargo cover, so its  usefulness as a hatchback with the seats raised is negligible. Lowering the  backseats does make it more versatile than sedan rivals &mdash; including  the Corolla &mdash; but it's not quite as spacious as the Mazda 3 or  Volkswagen Golf. </p>\n  \n<p>Small-item  storage is much better, with eight (!) cupholders spread equally front and  rear. The enormous bottle holders in the rear doors are of particular note. The  front armrest bin is also quite large, while the existence of a small  smartphone bin forward of the shifter is appreciated even if there's not quite  enough room to stuff both your phone and its wire. </p>\n\n<p><strong>What About Safety?</strong><br>\nIn  addition to the typical or mandated safety features, the Scion iM comes with  side airbags up front, full-length side curtain airbags, a driver knee airbag  and a passenger seat cushion airbag that helps keeps the occupant in an ideal  position during a frontal collision. A rearview camera is standard, as is a  hill-hold function for vehicles with the manual transmission.</p>\n  \n<p>In  Edmunds brake testing, the iM came to an emergency stop from 60 mph in 122  feet, which is average for the segment. It also performed several stops of a  similar distance, demonstrating a resistance to brake fade.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What Kind of Fuel Economy  Does It Get?</strong><br>\nThe  EPA estimates fuel economy at 32 mpg in combined driving (28 city/37 highway)  with the CVT. With a manual, the iM gets 1 less mpg across the board. Meanwhile,  we averaged 33.2 mpg with the CVT on our standardized evaluation route. Either  way, these figures are certainly thrifty, but others in the class are even more  efficient and more powerful to boot. In other words, don't expect a fuel  economy tradeoff for that laggardly acceleration.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What Does the Scion iM  Compete Against?</strong><br>\nThe  Edmunds \"A\"-rated Mazda 3 is a standout in the hatchback class, as is  the Volkswagen Golf. Both of these cars are better overall than the Scion iM,  offering more refinement, stronger performance and larger cabins. We strongly  suggest testing them out before committing to the dotted line. To a lesser  degree but still stronger than the Scion are the Ford Focus and Kia Forte 5  hatchbacks.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Why Should You Consider This  Car?</strong><br>\nThe  Scion iM offers lots of value to singles or young couples in search of a daily  commuter car that can handle the odd weekend road trip. It's comfortable, safe  and packed with features for a reasonable price, while boasting added value by  way of two years of free scheduled maintenance, a no-haggle buying experience  and Toyota's sterling reputation for reliability. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Why Should You Think Twice About  This Car?</strong><br>\nThe  main rivals listed above are quite simply more well-rounded and appealing,  especially in terms of performance, fuel economy and interior space. The Scion  iM is an OK choice, but others are stronger overall. </p>\n\n<p><em>The manufacturer provided Edmunds  this vehicle for the purposes of evaluation.</em></p>"
